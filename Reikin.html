											Similar to a domain expansion (JJK) or ig a pocket dimension. Creates a world seperate to the current one that is entirely able to be controlled by the 'artist' (whoever is in possession  of the sketch pages). Highly colorful, typically is able to emulate in perfect precision the ideas of the 'artist'. Whoever controls the sketch pages has complete control of the domain. (<span style="color:#6f0000">Reikin</span> keeps these on her person at all times)(Max: 3 gods (<span style="color:#6f0000">Reikin</span> does not count, she is the power supply) or 3 mortals [in the sketchbook's eyes, mortals and gods are the same. I.e. <span style="color:#c5b9cd">Yulz</span>, <span style="color:#77309F">Aki</span>, a Mortal, and <span style="color:#6f0000">Reikin</span> can be in the domain at the same time, but no more])

										<p>
											Able to, with high limitations, alter the physical world. This involves things such as making rocks appear blue, or 'fine tuning' the appearance of certain things for them to be more beautiful. Can, if enough power is drained into this, give life to drawings that Yulz can 'script' (i.e. can create a pair of ink wolves, but cannot sustain them for too long. When the ink dries, the images will disappear.)

				<li><h3> Insults </h3></li>

						<ul type=dot>
							<li> Reactive </li>
								<ul type=none>
									<li>
										<p>
											Given a creative insult, however strongly a person reacts to the insult (in anyway) will cause activation of the skill. Negative reactions will bounce it onto themself (i.e. "You are a two-faced toad.", if they reacted negatively, they would temporarily appear as that.), if the person has a positive reaction, the skill will rebound and attack the nearest inanimate object (permanent. Hard reminder that words stick around, regardless of how bad one wants to forget they happened). The more mild the reaction, the less the skill will be able to do.
